    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A Salvadorian treat, these homemade tortillas stuffed with cheese are
      great with a traditional coleslaw called curtido. To serve, slice open one
      side of a pupusa, and spoon curtido into the opening. Farmer's cheese or
      mozzarella can be substituted for queso blanco.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste (Optional)</li>

      <li>
        Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Gently lay
        plantain strips into hot oil; drizzle vanilla extract over plantains and
        season with cinnamon. Place a cover on the skillet and cook the
        plantains until browned completely, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Transfer
        plantains to a plate lined with paper towel to drain; sprinkle sugar
        over the plantains.
