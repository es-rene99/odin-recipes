    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A Salvadorian treat, these homemade tortillas stuffed with cheese are
      great with a traditional coleslaw called curtido. To serve, slice open one
      side of a pupusa, and spoon curtido into the opening. Farmer's cheese or
      mozzarella can be substituted for queso blanco.

        Shape the dough into eight, 2 inch diameter balls. On a lightly floured
        surface, roll out each ball into 6 inch diameter round. Sprinkle 1/4 cup
        queso fresco over each round. Place a second tortilla over the cheese,
        and pinch the edges together to seal in the cheese.

        Heat ungreased skillet over medium-high heat. Place one tortilla into
        the skillet at a time, and cook until cheese melts and tortillas are
        lightly browned, about 2 minutes on each side.
